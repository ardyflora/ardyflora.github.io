# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

Hi! This is my portfolio, where you will find **where I work**, **what I do in my free time**, etc etc.


## Why a Portfolio?

I always wanted a portfolio, I think being a Software Engineer anywhere i use to travel. I use to get this suggestion "You really should have a portfolio"

I didn't want a portfolio because of the suggestions only, I really thought it makes you professional and plus you can document and show your projects in whatever way you like.

## Which template did I use?

I used a template and modified it to my needs.

## What did I learn though the process?

I learned a thing or two:

- Learned how to read someone else code and understand it
	> Go into different files and figure out what this line does
	> Troubleshoot when things are not working as they should be.

- Developed skills on using HTML and CSS
	> how to edit HTML and CSS to do changes on the HTML to my needs

## Development setup
